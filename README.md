# README: To-Do List Application (Java)

This Java-based To-Do List application is a simple, yet effective tool for managing daily tasks. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, helping them stay organized and productive.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can easily add new tasks with a description and due date.
- **View Tasks**: The app displays all tasks in a neat, ordered list.
- **Mark Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete.
- **Delete Task**: Easily remove completed or unwanted tasks from the list.
- **Save and Load**: Task lists are saved to a file so they can be retrieved later, ensuring that your to-do list persists even after closing the application.

## Usage

The application starts with a simple menu where you can:
   - Add new tasks
   - View all current tasks
   - Mark tasks as complete
   - Delete tasks
   - Save or load tasks from a file

**Input and Task Management**:
   - When adding a task, you will be prompted to enter a task description and optional due date.
   - The tasks are saved in a text file for persistence across sessions.

## Personal Reflection

### Why I Made This Application
I created this To-Do List app to practice my skills in Java programming while solving a practical need that I encountered daily. I found that using a simple, command-line-based task manager was a great way to hone my coding abilities, while also creating something I could use to manage my own workflow. This small project bridges two interests of mineâ€”programming and productivity.

### What I Learned
I deepened my understanding of file handling in Java, particularly the importance of managing input/output for saving and loading data. I also learned how to better structure my classes to keep the code modular and clean. Managing user input, especially when handling multiple tasks and editing, required extra attention to detail, which sharpened my skills in error-handling and logic flow.

### Future Plans
In the future, I plan to implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing, which would make the app more user-friendly. Additionally, I aim to introduce features like task categorization, priority levels, and due date reminders. Integrating this with online storage or syncing between devices is another exciting possibility for expanding the functionality of this app.
